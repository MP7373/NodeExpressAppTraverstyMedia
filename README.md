# nodeExpressApp
A basic node app with CRUD functionality using MongoDB, Express, Mongoose ODM, and PUG templates

I didn't deploy because it cost $5 a month to deploy on Digital Ocean and i'm not willing to pay that.

To run locally you need node, npm, and mongodb installed. (mongodb is not included this repo)

From the outer mongodb directory cd to bin

Then mongod and make sure it's on port 27017

In another terminal window navigate to the bin directory and mongo

Crate a db called nodekb by typing use nodekb

Open another terminal window and navigate to the root directory of this repo (the one containing app.js)

Type node app.js

Open localhost:3000 in a web browser

These are really rough instructions because I did this for practice and don't really expect people to clone this.
